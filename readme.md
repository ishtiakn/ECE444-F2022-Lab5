#### User Story 3
"As a student, I want the option to see a visualization of the relations between a course and its pre-requisites, co-requisites, courses that require it as a pre-requisite, and exclusions so that I can quickly assess my eligibility for a course and its wider effect on other course in my upcoming timetables. I also want the visualized courses to be clickable so that I may further investigate them."<br />
